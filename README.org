* sql-trino.el

** What is it?

Emacs comes with a SQL interpreter which is able to open a connection to databases and present you with a prompt you are probably familiar with (e.g. =mysql>=, =pgsql>=, =trino>=, etc.). This mode gives you the ability to do that for Trino.

** How do I get it?

The canonical repository for the source code is https://github.com/regadas/sql-trino.

The recommended way to install the package is to utilize Emacs's =package.el= along with MELPA. To set this up, please follow MELPA's [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][getting started guide]], and then run =M-x package-install sql-trino=.

** Requirements

Download the [[https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/trino/trino-cli/378/trino-cli-378-executable.jar][Trino CLI]], rename it to =trino= and put it in your =$PATH=.

** How do I use it?

Within Emacs, run =M-x sql-trino=. You will be prompted by a minibuffer for a server. Enter a server and you should be greeted by a SQLi buffer with a =trino>= prompt.

From there you can either type queries in this buffer, or open a =sql-mode= buffer and send chunks of SQL over to the SQLi buffer with the requisite key-chords.
